<p>When the app is loaded, enter in a username for player 1 and player 2 and click play to begin!</p>

<p>Game 1(Hang Man): Lets a user enter in a word that the other user has to guess 1 character at a time. After this user has entered the winning characters. It would go to a new page hiding the word chosen. Letâ€™s the second user pick a character A-Z trying to guess the correct word the first user has chosen. If you choose a wrong character a part of a stick figure character would be draw. If you choose the correct character the letter will be filled into the blank. _ A _ _ something like that. If the stick figure person is complete than you lose the game and the word is filled in.</p>

<p>Game 2(Connect 4): The Connect 4 game board has 5 rows and 5 columns. Only 2 users can play at one time. First user is always red and user two is always blue. The first player to connect 4 squares wins the game. Each user can place their square anywhere on the board that is not already chosen. If red user gets 4 in a row their squares will change color to orange notifying that you won the game and blue will be purple.</p>

<p>Game 3(Rock Paper Scissors app): Each player gets to choose from rock paper or scissors. Rock beats scissors. Scissors beats paper and paper beats rock. We can set up a tournament so if we have more users than just 2 we can do a best 2 out of 3 where each user plays each other once in a best 2 out of 3 series.</p>
  
<p>Scoreboard: Keeps track of the score for all users. The score board may be seen between game sessions and carries over across all games. The winner of each game mode and each series recieves a point to that users total.</p>
